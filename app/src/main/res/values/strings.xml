    <string name="info_obudu">Obudu Mountain Resort (formerly known as the Obudu Cattle Ranch) is a ranch
        and resort on the Obudu Plateau in Cross River State, Nigeria. It was developed in 1951 by Mr. McCaughley,
        a Scot who first explored the mountain ranges in 1949. He camped on the mountaintop of the Oshie Ridge on
        the Sankwala Mountains for a month before returning with Mr. Hugh Jones a fellow rancher who, in 1951,
        together with Dr Crawfeild developed the Obudu Cattle Ranch. Although the ranch has been through troubles
        since, it has very recently been rehabilitated to its former glory. A recently added cable car from the
        base to the top of the plateau gives visitors a scenic view while bypassing the extremely winding road to
        the top</string>
